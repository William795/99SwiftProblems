# 99SwiftProblems
 https://www.enekoalonso.com/projects/99-swift-problems/
Just slowly working my way through these problems on the side while i'm job hunting and working a part time job

Areas that these problems cover are...
Linked Lists           (P 01 - 30)
Arithmetic.            (P 31 - 45)
Logic and Codes        (P 46 - 53)
Binary Trees           (P 54 - 69)
Multiway Trees.        (P 70 - 79)
Graphs                 (P 80 - 89)
Miscellaneous Problems (P 90 - 99)

I completed some of the early/easy problems when I first found these challenges half a year ago, (largely with the use of Google/Stackoverflow/Github) and after taking a break from coding, largly spawned from my current grunt work job and getting an idea of mine to make an app for said job brickwalled for over 2 months, so I thought that I would get back in the swing of things by restarting from scratch and (hopefully) complete (at least) one problem each day off that I have off from work if not more.
